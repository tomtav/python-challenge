# Data Analysis with Python

## Background

Using the basic concepts learned to complete **2** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation.

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* Using a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictional company. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* The Python script analyzes the records and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* The Python script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the following results:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

## PyPoll

![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* Using a python script to assist with helping a small, rural fictional town modernize its vote-counting process. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.

* The Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* The Python script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the following results:

  ```text
  =====================================
         ELECTION RESULTS
  =====================================

  Total Votes : 3521001

  Li received 14.0% of votes for a total of 492940 votes.
  Khan received 63.0% of votes for a total of 2218231 votes.
  O'Tooley received 3.0% of votes for a total of 105630 votes.
  Correy received 20.0% of votes for a total of 704200 votes.

  =====================================

  THE WINNER OF THE ELECTION IS KHAN!
